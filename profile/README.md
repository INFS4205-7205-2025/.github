👋 Welcome to INFS4205/7205 Advanced Techniques in High-Dimensional Data
Welcome to the official organization space for INFS4205/7205: Advanced Techniques in High-Dimensional Data at The University of Queensland! This is where data meets innovation, creativity, and real-world impact.

Our course empowers students to push the boundaries of high-dimensional data analytics, blending advanced query design, efficient indexing, and interactive data visualization into innovative solutions.

🚀 Explore Our Project Showcase
Students dive into two exciting project streams:

🧭 Type I — Research-Oriented Query Exploration
Students design, implement, and analyze advanced spatial and spatio-temporal queries using real-world data (e.g., trajectory analysis, skyline queries, similarity search). They compare indexing techniques such as R-trees, k-d trees, and quadtrees, and rigorously benchmark performance using PostgreSQL and beyond.

Sample highlight queries include:
- Find the top K nearest restaurants with multi-index comparisons
- Analyze trajectories for optimal routing under spatial-temporal constraints
- Identify skyline points to support urban planning or social venue analysis

💻 Type II — Web-Based Interactive Analytics
Students build full-stack web applications to empower users to explore high-dimensional datasets through intuitive and dynamic interfaces. These apps combine modern frontend frameworks (e.g., React) with powerful backend logic (Node.js, Python, PostgreSQL).

Example features include:

- Customizable spatial search tools (e.g., "Find all cafes within 500m open after 6pm")
- AI-enhanced natural language queries for databases
- Real-time geospatial visualizations using interactive maps and charts
