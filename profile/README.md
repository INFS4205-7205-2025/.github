### 👋 Welcome

Welcome to the official organization space for **INFS4205/7205: Advanced Techniques in High-Dimensional Data** at The University of Queensland! This is where data meets innovation, creativity, and real-world impact.

Our course empowers students to push the boundaries of high-dimensional data analytics, blending advanced query design, efficient indexing, and interactive data visualization into innovative solutions.

---

### 🚀 Project Showcase

Students explore two exciting streams:

#### 🧭 Type I — Research-Oriented Query Exploration

Students design, implement, and analyze advanced spatial and spatio-temporal queries using real-world data (e.g., trajectory analysis, skyline queries, similarity search). They rigorously compare indexing techniques such as R-trees, k-d trees, and quadtrees using PostgreSQL and beyond.

**Sample highlight queries:**
- Find the top K nearest restaurants with multi-index comparisons
- Analyze trajectories for optimal routing under spatial-temporal constraints
- Identify skyline points to support urban planning or venue selection

#### 💻 Type II — Interactive Web-Based Analytics

Students build full-stack web applications to explore high-dimensional datasets through intuitive, dynamic interfaces. These apps integrate modern frontend frameworks (e.g., React) with powerful backend logic (Node.js, Python, PostgreSQL). AI-assisted IDE, e.g., Cursor, is encouraged to be used.

🌟 **Sample Project**: [McDonalds-Store-Locator](https://github.com/INFS4205-7205-2025/McDonalds-Store-Locator) - Zixin Wang

**Example features:**
- Customizable spatial search tools (e.g., *"Find all cafes within 500m open after 6pm"*)
- AI-enhanced natural language database queries
- Real-time geospatial visualizations and dashboards
